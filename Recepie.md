RECEPIE OF CAKE

    STEP 1:Position a rack in the middle of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees. Grease two 8-inch cake pans and line the bottoms with parchment paper .

    STEP 2:In a medium bowl, sift together the flour, cocoa, baking soda and salt.

    STEP 3:In a 2-cup liquid measuring cup or small bowl, combine the buttermilk or beet juice and red food coloring, if using.

    STEP 4:In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment — or, if using a hand-mixer, in a large bowl — combine the sugar, butter and oil. Beat on medium speed until light and fluffy, 1 to 2 minutes, stopping to scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl to ensure the mixture is evenly creamed. Reduce the mixer speed to medium-low and add the vanilla, followed by the eggs, one at a time, beating until each is emulsified into the batter before adding another. Scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl as needed, and after the last egg is added, mix until no streaks remain, but no longer than another 20 seconds to avoid beating too much extra air into the batter.

    STEP 5:With the mixer on low speed, add about half of the buttermilk mixture — carefully, as it may splash — and allow it to fully emulsify into the batter. With the mixer running, sprinkle in half of the flour mixture, followed by the remaining buttermilk mixture. Stop to scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl as needed and add the remaining flour mixture. Increase the speed to medium and mix until just a few streaks remain, no longer than 15 seconds. Remove the bowl from the mixer and, using a rubber spatula, fold the batter, ensuring it is evenly mixed and no streaks or lumps remain. Do not overmix, or your cake will be dense and tough.

    STEP 6:Divide the batter between the cake pans; each pan should get about 750 grams of batter. Using a small offset spatula or spoon, level the batter in each pan. Grasp each pan by the rim on opposite sides, lift it up about 3 inches and drop it onto the counter 2 or 3 times to release any large air bubbles.

    STEP 7:Bake the cakes for 40 to 50 minutes, or until the cakes pull away from the sides of the pan and the top springs back when lightly pressed or a skewer inserted in the center comes out with a few moist crumbs.

    STEP 8:Let cakes cool in their pans on a wire rack for 20 minutes, then run a thin knife around the edge and gently invert onto a wire rack. Remove the pans and parchment and allow the cakes to cool upside-down, for at least 2 hours, before cutting or frosting. To make it easier to frost the cake, you may wrap cooled cake layers airtight and freeze for 30 minutes (or up to 3 months). (If you let cakes cool completely in their pans, they may become damp.)

    STEP 9:Make the frosting: In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment — or, if using a hand-mixer, in a large bowl — combine the cream cheese, butter, vanilla and salt. Beat on medium to medium-high speed until well combined and fluffy, about 1 minute. Turn the mixer off, and add 1 cup of the confectioners’ sugar. Starting on low speed and increasing to medium, beat to combine, then turn the mixer off. Add the remaining confectioners’ sugar, 1 cup or so at a time, and beat, starting on low and increasing to medium, until the frosting is fluffy and begins to stiffen, about 2 minutes, scraping down the sides as needed. Cover and refrigerate the frosting for at least 1 hour or until ready to use.

    STEP 10:Assemble the cake: If the frosting has stiffened, beat it briefly, by hand or using the paddle attachment on your mixer, until it’s fluffy and spreadable.

    Lay one cake layer on a plate or platter and top with about 1 1/2 cups of the frosting. Spread the frosting into an even layer, then top with the second cake layer. Coat the top and sides of the cake with the remaining frosting, starting with a crumb coat (see NOTES), if desired. Decorate with the pecans if desired.
